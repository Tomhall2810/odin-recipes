        <li>Vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

            Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg
            
            Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min).
        </li>
        <li>Boil a kettle

            Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat
            
            Once hot, add the beef mince to the pan and cook for 3-4 min or until starting to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go.</li>
            <li>
                Add the gnocchi to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat
                
                Cook the gnocchi for 3 min or until it begins to rise to the top of the pot
                
                Once done, drain the gnocchi.</li>
                <li>Once the beef mince has started to brown, add the Marmite to the pan with the dried oregano, dried basil, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and roasted garlic paste and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant.</li>
                <li>
                    Add the chopped tomatoes with 100ml boiled water, a pinch of sugar and a generous pinch of salt and pepper, then bring to the boil over a high heat
                    
                    Cook for 2-3 min or until the beef has cooked through (no pink meat!) and the sauce has thickened to a ragù-like consistency
                    
                    Note: Please make sure you cook your beef mince thoroughly (until piping hot!) as cooking equipment varies.</li>
                    <li>Once the sauce has thickened, add in the drained gnocchi and give everything a good mix up – this is your herby beef gnocchi bolognese.</li>
                    <li>Tear the basil leaves over the herby beef gnocchi bolognese

                        Wash the rocket, then pat dry with kitchen paper
                        
                        Set the herby beef gnocchi bolognese in the centre of the table, ready to share
                        
                        Top with the grated Italian hard cheese and rocket, then let everyone dig in.
                        
                        Enjoy!</li>
