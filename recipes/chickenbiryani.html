        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air
                
                Peel and dice the brown onion
                
                Chop the chicken breast portions into bite-sized pieces
                
                Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat.</li>

                <li>Once the pan is hot, add the diced onion, curry powder and a pinch of salt and pepper

                    Cook for 2 min or until the onion is starting to soften.</li>

                    <li>Meanwhile, trim, then cut the green beans in half.

                    </li>

                    <li>Add the chopped chicken to the pan and cook for 2 min

                        Stir in the chicken stock mix and add the tomato paste
                        
                        Tip: Add a drizzle of oil if the pan looks a little dry.</li>

                        <li>Cook for 2 min further or until the chicken is starting to brown

                            Once brown, add the basmati rice to the pan and stir to coat the grains in the spice and oil.</li>

                            <li>Add 300ml cold water to the pan and bring to the boil over a high heat

                                Once boiling, add the halved green beans and sultanas.</li>

                                <li>Give everything a good mix, then reduce the heat to low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until the water has absorbed and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

                                    Tip: Add a splash of water if the rice is not cooked or the mixture is a little dry
                                    
                                    Once done, taste for seasoning, adding more salt and pepper if needed â€“ this is your chicken biryani
                                    
                                    Serve the chicken biryani with a dollop of natural yoghurt over the top
                                    
                                    Enjoy!
