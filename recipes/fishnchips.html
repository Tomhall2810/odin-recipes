        <h2>Fish and chips gousto style</h2>

        <p>Our secret to a crisp, flavourful "beer" batter isn't beer at all... it's Marmite! Serve with chunky chip shop chips, mushy peas and lemon mayo.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>30ml tomato ketchup</li>
            <li>30ml red wine vinegar</li>
            <li>1 lemon</li>
            <li>2 x 100g basa fillets</li>
            <li>4 white potatoes</li>
            <li>160g blanched peas</li>
            <li>50ml mayonnaise</li>
            <li>8g Marmite</li>
            <li>1 shallot</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Flour</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Vegetable oil</li>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a full kettle

                    Peel the potatoes and chop them into chunky chips, then add them to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a generous pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat
                    
                    Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 6-8 min or until slightly softened.</li>

                    <li>Meanwhile, add 1 tbsp [2 tbsp] vegetable oil to a deep baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 5 min or until the oil is hot

                        Peel and finely chop the shallot[s]
                        
                        Combine the chopped shallot with the mayo and the juice of 1/2 [1] lemon in a small bowl
                        
                        Season with a pinch of salt and give everything a good stir – this is your lemon mayo</li>

                        <li>Once done, drain the softened chunky chips and reserve the pot, give them a shake in the colander until the edges have fluffed up a little

                            Carefully remove the baking tray of hot oil from the oven and add the fluffed chunky chips
                            
                            Season them with salt and turn them a few times until they're fully coated in the oil
                            
                            Put the tray in the oven for 30 min or until golden and crisp.</li>

                            <li>Meanwhile, combine the Marmite and 80ml [160ml] very cold water in a small bowl, stirring continuously until fully combined – this is your Marmite water

                                Add 60g [120g] flour to a separate large bowl with half of the red wine vinegar (save the rest for later!), a generous pinch of salt and the Marmite water
                                
                                Stir everything together thoroughly until there are no lumps, then set aside for later – this is your batter.</li>

                                <li>Pat the basa fillets dry with kitchen paper and cut each fillet in half on a diagonal

                                    Season the basa with a pinch of salt and sprinkle both sides with flour until fully coated, then tap off any excess
                                    
                                    Reboil a kettle.</li>

                                    <li>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to coat the base of the pan) over a high heat

                                        Once the pan is hot, dip the floured basa into the batter and turn it several times until fully coated, then add the coated basa to the pan and cook for 3-4 min on each side until cooked through, golden and crispy – this is your battered fish
                                        
                                        Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily.</li>

                                        <li>Add the blanched peas to the reserved pot, cover them with boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

                                            Cook for 1 min or until they're warmed through, then drain and return to the pot with a knob of butter
                                            
                                            Mash the peas until they come together nicely – these are your mushy peas
                                            
                                            Cut the remaining lemon into wedges
                                            
                                            Serve the battered fish with the chunky chips and mushy peas to the side
                                            
                                            Sprinkle the chips with the remaining red wine vinegar – these are your salt & vinegar chips
                                            
                                            Serve with the ketchup and lemon mayo to the side for dipping, and garnish with a lemon wedge
                                            
                                            Enjoy!</li>
